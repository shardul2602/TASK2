## Technical Details

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Local Storage

The app automatically saves your tasks to the browser's localStorage, so your tasks will persist between browser sessions.

## Customization

You can easily customize the app by modifying:
- Colors in `style.css` (look for CSS custom properties)
- Animations and transitions
- Layout and spacing
- Add new features in `script.js`

## Troubleshooting

- If tasks don't save, make sure you're using a modern browser
- If the app doesn't load, check that all three files are in the same directory
- Clear browser cache if you experience any issues
